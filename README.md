# Cogoff

## Definition

**Cogoff** (noun): The process of transferring mental tasks to external tools or technology to reduce cognitive demand.

*Derived from "cognitive offloading"*

*Coined by [@prntwrld](https://github.com/prntwrld)*

## Description

Cogoff describes the increasingly common phenomenon where individuals rely on external digital systems (particularly AI) to perform cognitive tasks that they would otherwise handle mentally. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the tendency to offload cognitive processes increases, sometimes leading to atrophy of mental skills.

## Examples

- Using a calculator app for basic arithmetic
- Relying on GPS navigation instead of spatial memory
- Using AI to write emails or messages
- Storing information in notes apps instead of memorizing
- Asking virtual assistants for information rather than recalling it
- Using autocomplete instead of spelling words independently

## Research Context

The concept builds upon established research in cognitive psychology about external cognition and distributed cognitive processes. Key related research areas include:

- Cognitive load theory
- Extended mind thesis
- Digital amnesia
- AI-induced cognitive atrophy (AICICA)
- Technology dependence

## Usage

"When people depend heavily on AI systems, they engage in cogoff more frequently, sometimes forgetting basic skills they once performed effortlessly."
